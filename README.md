This repository holds supplementary Go cryptography libraries.

## Download/Install

The easiest way to install is to run `go get -u github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto/...`. You
can also manually git clone the repository to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto`.

This module is backwards compatible with [x/crypto](https://github.com/golang/crypto),
so you can simply replace all imports of `golang.org/x/crypto` with
`github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto`.
